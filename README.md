## This is a package that attempts to QC ATACseq libraries 

and it does some smoothing etc. in preparation for feeding the coverage to 
either the 'derFinder' or 'csaw' Bioconductor packages, since I don't feel like
reinventing the wheel.  Fitting a mixture model for nucleosome occupancy, etc.
are secondary objectives and will be dealt with as the need arises.
